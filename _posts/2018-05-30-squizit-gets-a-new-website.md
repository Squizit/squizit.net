Hi this is Ben, founder of Squizit and creator of this website. Squizit is a production company dedicated to bringing creating film, music, and live events. Currently Squizit is no more than an idea and a dream and I am not exactly sure what direction I want it to go. I hope that in creating this website for us to share our progress, I will figure out exactly what I want Squizit to be. Our first project will be a t-shirt store and it will be launching sometime before the end of the summer. The goal is to create a few mini stores for different groups of passionate creators. We have designs for musicians, computer nerds, and many other groups of people. Check back soon for more information!
