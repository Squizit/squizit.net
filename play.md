## Play
Squizit Play, previously known as Squizit Gaming, is the hub for all gaming-related events and content. Squizit Play will primarially be a YouTube channel and livestream. We also plan to host LAN events and tournoments in the future. We also hope to release card games and board games. Who knows, maybe we will even make a video game!
