# This is the Squizit website!

This is Ben Saltz's (AKA Squizit) portfolio/project/shared website. The primary domain (squizit.net) is dedicated for Ben's chosen use. Eventually there will be additional other sites on subdomains that are made for various other things/people.

In the mean time, feel free to check out the cool animations! The site is live on [squizit.net](http://squizit.net/)!
